Dictionary Word Auto Completion

Most keyboards used in mobile devices provide the option of auto-complete, which gives a list of candidate words that you wish to type given a prefix of the word you enter. 

For instance, when you type "sh", it will give you a list of candidate words such as "she", "shell", "ship", etc. 

Our goal is to write a program that auto-completes any word given a prefix of it.
