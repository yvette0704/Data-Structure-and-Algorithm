# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm

This is the my course work from the class Emory CS 323: Data Structure and Algorithm.

This is an advanced course in computer science, studying different ways of processing data using various structures and algorithms. This course covers data structures such as heaps, trees, graphs as well as their applications in the construction of efficient algorithms for select, sort, balance, match, etc. Advanced topics such as dynamic programming, network flow, linear programming are also discussed
